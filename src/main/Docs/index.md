# The wm-installation project

This project was started as a set of scripts for doing an automated installation of the [webMethods integration platform](https://www.softwareag.com/de_de/platform/integration-apis/webmethods-integration.html) by [Software AG](https://www.softwareag.com/).

As it turned out, these scripts are basically convenient wrappers of the **Software AG Installer**. In other words, there
is nothing that prevents you from using them to install other Software AG products, as long as that can be done by running the
installer.
